For outdoor adventurers seeking new destinations, Park Explorer will help you discover the hidden gems of nature that are America national parks. Park Explorer randomly selects one of the 58 national parks and displays its profile (hence where the Tinder in Park Explorer comes from). After being introduced to what wonders that particular park has to offer, users can then follow a link to find more infomation or to book a stay!
